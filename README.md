# Audio Signal Processing System â€“ Treble & Bass Control, Mixer, and Microphone Preamp

## Project Overview

This project implements an Audio Signal Processing System designed to process audio signals with dynamic equalization features such as treble and bass control, as well as mixing multiple audio inputs and amplifying microphone signals. The goal of this project is to provide precise tonal adjustments, combine multiple audio sources with minimal distortion, and amplify microphone inputs with clear signal integrity.

### Key Features:
- **Treble and Bass Control**: Dynamic audio equalization for tonal adjustments.
- **Mixer Circuit**: Combines multiple audio signals while minimizing distortion.
- **Microphone Preamp Circuit**: Amplifies microphone signals for optimal gain control.
- **PCB Design**: Optimized for minimal interference and efficient power distribution.
- **SPICE Simulation**: Validates and optimizes frequency response and circuit behavior.

## Project Components

1. **Treble and Bass Control Circuit**  
   - Designed to adjust the high and low frequencies of the audio signal for dynamic sound shaping.

2. **Mixer Circuit**  
   - Combines multiple audio signals while maintaining signal integrity and minimizing distortion.

3. **Microphone Preamp Circuit**  
   - Amplifies microphone signals for optimal clarity and gain control, ensuring high-quality audio capture.

4. **PCB Design & Layout**  
   - Designed and routed using Altium, ensuring minimal interference and optimal signal quality.
  
5. **Simulation**  
   - SPICE simulations performed in Altium to validate circuit performance and optimize frequency response.

## How It Works

1. **Audio Signal Input**: The audio signals (e.g., from an audio source or microphone) are input into the system.
2. **Treble & Bass Adjustment**: The treble and bass control circuit allows the user to adjust the tonal balance of the audio signal.
3. **Mixing**: The mixer combines multiple audio signals into one, maintaining a clear and balanced output.
4. **Amplification**: The microphone preamplifier amplifies any microphone input signals to a suitable level.
5. **Output**: The final mixed and amplified audio signal is output to speakers or recording devices.
